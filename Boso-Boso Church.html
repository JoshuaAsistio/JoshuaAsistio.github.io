          The Nuestra Señora de la Annunciata Parish Church, also known as
          Bosoboso Church or Boso-Boso Church, is a Roman Catholic parish church
          located in Sitio Old Boso-Boso, Barangay San Jose in Antipolo, Rizal,
          Philippines. The first church was built as a mission church by the
          Franciscans in 1669. Originally, it served the Dumagat people of
          Lanatin and Linotan in the mountains of modern-day Rizal province. The
          Jesuits eventually took over the mission and the church in 1741. It
          was turned over to secular priests in 1768 when the Jesuits were
          expelled from the Philippines and other Spanish realms. In 1880, an
          earthquake caused significant damage to the church. Owing to the
          dwindling population in the area, the damaged portions of the church
          were not rebuilt. In 1930, the Americans planned to build a dam in the
          surrounding area, and the remaining inhabitants were ordered to
          resettle elsewhere. The project was eventually abandoned due to a
          discovered fault in the region, yet people did not return until the
          time of the Japanese Occupation. Whatever remained of the structure
          was subsequently razed to the ground by the Japanese, leaving only the
          lower portion of the original façade intact. As the area was
          eventually resettled, administration of the parish was taken over by
          the Camillian Order in 1986, who helped organize rebuilding of the
          church. The restoration was completed in 1995, preserving the ruins of
          the façade, with the new portions built as close as possible to the
          simple, sparse architecture of the original.
