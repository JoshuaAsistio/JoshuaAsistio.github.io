          originally opened to the public as a restaurant in 1995. Eventually,
          it included lodgings and other recreation and events facilities. But
          the main highlight is the 360Â° View Deck, which allows a panoramic
          view of the surrounding area including the Metro manila cityscape in
          the distance and an unforgettable sunset. A thrilling hanging bridge
          leads to the viewing platform.
