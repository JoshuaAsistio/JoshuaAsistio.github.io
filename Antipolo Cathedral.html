          The Antipolo Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in
          Antipolo City, Rizal in the Philippines. It is also the Immaculate
          Conception Parish and referred by locals as "Simbahan ng Antipolo". It
          enshrines the Marian image of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage
          (Spanish: Nuestra Se√±ora de la Paz y Buen Viaje), and is the seat of
          the Bishop of Antipolo. The shrine attracts millions of pilgrims
          annually, especially during the Pilgrimage Season which commences with
          the Alay Lakad from the Quiapo Church on April 30 and lasts throughout
          the month of Mary.
