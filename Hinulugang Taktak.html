          Hinulugang Taktak is a waterfall in the Philippines found in the
          province of Rizal on Luzon island. The waterfall area has been
          designated as a National Park by the Department of Environment and
          Natural Resources and is one of the two most popular tourist spots in
          Antipolo, Rizal's capital, the other being the Antipolo Cathedral. In
          1990, the waterfall has also been proclaimed as a National Historical
          Shrine under Republic Act No. 6964.The waters are polluted and not
          suitable for swimming But many LGU's and NGU's are acting to save its
          natural beauty by efforts to preserve its upper part for park use, and
          not for abusive, trash use.
