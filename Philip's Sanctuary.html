          Phillip's Sanctuary is an Agro-forestry farm and teambuilding resort
          that was established in 1989. When the property was acquired, it only
          had cogon grass and tree stumps all over the place. It showed the
          brutal neglect of the environment that was once at one time, a
          forested place full of wildlife.
