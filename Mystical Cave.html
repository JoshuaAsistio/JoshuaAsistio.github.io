          One of Antipolo's popular destination that offers nature trips, cave
          exploration and mountain sight seeing Mystical Cave is just about
          20+kms from Manila at the lower portion of Antipolo. It is being
          maintained by Inday Nelly who bought the large parcel of land (450+
          hectares) where the cave is located back in 1970. The cave was
          "developed for site seeing." Steps were constructed at the cave
          entrance, the cave floor was filled with earth to level it
          substantially and rudimentary electric lighting was introduced into
          the cave for the tourists. It is a very good destination for
          educational field trips. The cave has a rather predominant religious
          influence. Numerous natural rock formations in the cave have been
          interpreted as religious figures and said to have healing powers. Much
          like how mystical Mt. Banahaw attracts pilgrims, people go to this
          mystical cave to heal themselves. The seven floors deep cave attracts
          not just adventurers and cave lovers, but also those from education
          institutions who want to learn more about stalagmites and the like.
          The molds of stones and crystals inside the cave are resemblances of
          Catholics images, making it yet another pilgrim site to visit in the
          city.
